Turns out renewing creeps is not very cost effective. Better to just recreate the creeps in most situations.
        
## ToDo

### Pending
* Build fighting units.
* Automate road building from the spawn to the resources
* Increase reusePath option in the Creep.moveTo method to help save CPU.
* Use creep memory to store locations/paths.
* build different creeps based on how many extensions I have.
* Pick up dropped resources


### Done
* Figure out how to use extensions to store more energy.
    *  The exact location of extensions within a room does not matter,
    but they should be in the same room with the spawn (one extension can be used by several spawns).
    All the necessary energy should be in the spawn and extensions in the beginning of the creep creation.
* Make harvesters deposit energy in extensions.
* Build a network of roads around the spawn.
* Heal creeps.
* Move constants to a separate file.
* Road maintenance
* Create a parent Creep class with useful shortcuts.
* Charge cannons.
* Separation between harvesters and carriers.
* Use links to mine faster.

## Notes

### src/config.ts
config.ts is not checked in to avoid unnecessary checkins due to the count adjustments to the number of various units.
Current config.ts structure:
```javascript
module.exports = {
    workerCount:    x,
    builderCount:   x,
    upgraderCount:  x
}
```


### Attacking units
Put you ```TOUGH``` parts first. Under attack, the first parts to take hits are those specified first. 
Full damage to a part leads to complete disabling of it â€“ the creep can no longer perform this function.

### Random facts
* Cannons can heal/reinforce structures
*
